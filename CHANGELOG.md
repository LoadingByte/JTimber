0.2.0
-----

### Additions
* CollectionWrapper, ListWrapper and ArrayWrapper now accept all objects as elements (and not just parent-aware objects).
* Replace the WeakPAReference with the @Weak annotation on fields. The runtime hook directly interprets the annotation.

### Fixes
* Removed an unnecessary dependency on the SLF4J API from the JTimber API.

0.1.0
-----

### Notes
* This is the first iteration of the framework, so there aren't any changes to mention here.
